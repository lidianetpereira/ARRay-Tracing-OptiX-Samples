CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at /home/lidiane/Downloads/CLion-2019.3.5/clion-2019.3.5/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.15/Modules/FindOpenGL.cmake:275 (message):
  Policy CMP0072 is not set: FindOpenGL prefers GLVND by default when
  available.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0072" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  FindOpenGL found both a legacy GL library:

    OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so

  and GLVND libraries for OpenGL and GLX:

    OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so
    OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX.so

  OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE has not been set to "GLVND" or "LEGACY", so for
  compatibility with CMake 3.10 and below the legacy GL library will be used.

-- Found OpenGL: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so   
CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:58 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindOpenGLES2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "OpenGLES2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OpenGLES2" with
  any of the following names:

    OpenGLES2Config.cmake
    opengles2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "OpenGLES2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "OpenGLES2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "OpenGLES2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.


CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:66 (find_package):

  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OpenGL3" with any
  of the following names:

  Add the installation prefix of "OpenGL3" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "OpenGL3_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "OpenGL3" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
